			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>As we were given a first assessment about designing  a webpage in the first year of BSC. Computing, we designed an UI(User Interface) page as instructed by our module tuotor.The page that we have designed includes four web pages which consists of index.html which is called as landing page,about.html, cv.html,social.html,contact.html and models_gp.html.The aim of this report is to introduce our designed web pages and illustrate how the webpage was created. The sketches and preliminary wireframes of the designed webpages and experiences of learning web developnment in the first term, validation evidences of HTML are well described in this report.</p>
				<br>
			<h2>Description of the web design</h2>
			<p>Considering the instruction provided on the NILE, I have designed  four webpages which are well described below. </p>
				<ol>
					<h2><li>Home page</li></h2><br>
					<img src="image/Home1.png">
						<p>As we were instructed to design a home page creating an index html, I have designed an index page or home page creating header,section and footer in the body of page.Header consists of logo part and navigation bar where home, About me, Cv, social,contact and module gp events are included using flex,hover and transform property.When cursor is moved to the events of navigation bar,text rotates through X-axis by 360 degree in blue colour due to use of hover property,an andanimation. In the section blue coloured background of the page, two div classes are made using flex property where image is kept in the first div class and short introduction is given about me in the second div class.Similarly, four div classes are created in the footer part where social media links are included in first div, gmail in the 2nd div,call in the 3rd div class  and copyright act in the last div. </p>
					<h2><li>About me</li></h2>
					<img src="image/About1.png">
						<p>In about me page, I  have created a class and inserted an image on the background keeping footer and header same as of home page.I have given short description about my self in a block and placed in the right bottom of the section.I have used white transparent background on the block of description.</p>
					<h2><li>CV</li></h2>
					<img src="image/CV1.png">
						<p>Similarly, CV page was created making div classes and using css properties like in the above pages</p>
					<h2><li>social</li></h2>
					<img src="image/Social1.png">
						<p>Likewise,social page was created making two div classes and using flex property.Footer and header are same as of above pages.</p>
					<h2><li>Contact</li></h2>
					<img src="image/Contact1.png">
						<p>And, contact page was created by making a contact form and embedding a map of location New,Baneshowr.</p>
			</ol>
		<h2>Sketches of Webpages</h2>
			<p>Sketches are the most important part for making webpages.Taking the reference of sketch,webpages can be designed. They can be considered as building block of webpage.Sketches of the above webpages are given below:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Sketch of homepage</li>
			<img src="image/home.png">
			<li>Sketch of About me</li>
			<img src="image/aboutme.png">
			<li>Sketch of CV</li>
			<img src="image/cv.png">
			<li>Sketch of Social</li>
			<img src="image/social.png">
			<li>Sketch of contact</li>
			<img src="image/contact.png">
		</ol>
		<h2>Wireframes of Webpages</h2>
		<p>Wireframes are the images or set of images which display the functional elements of a wepage.Wireframes are used for planning a structure and functionality of web pages.In my wireframe of webpage, footer and header are same and we have made changes only on section.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Wireframe of home page</li>
			<img src="image/Homepage.jpg">
			<li>Wireframe of About me page</li>
			<img src="image/AboutPage.jpg">
			<li>Wireframe of CV page</li>
			<img src="image/CVpage.jpg">
			<li>Wireframe of social page</li>
			<img src="image/socialPage.jpg">
			<li>Wireframe of contact</li>
			<img src="image/contactPage.jpg">
		</ol>
		<h2>Experiences of learning web development of first term</h2>
			<p>Describing the experience of learning web development,we had the course of 9 weeks about web page in first term.In 1st week,introduction of module,web development and designing was described. We also learned to use GitHub,command lne and the text editor.In week 2, we were taught about Github and basics of HTML and css properties.IN topic 3,we futher discussed about HTML, Ottergram projrect and some more advanced CSS by using the display,positioning properties and use of flex property.In topic 4, layouts,positioning and introduction of flexbox were discussed.In topic 5, we learned about making responsive web design with media queries. In week 6, we learned about material design.Likewise, in week 7, different css3 properties that can be used for material design were discussed.In week 8,we learned to make HTMl forms and their validation and in week 9 web designed trends 2018 were dicussed.SO,in this 9 weeks we learned to design an effective web pages and now we are demonstrating the knowledge, skills that we have gained in first semester. Thus,we had an effective learning experiences in these 9 weeks.</p>
		<h2>Validation Evidences of HTML</h2>
		<p>For the validation evidence of HTML,we tested our all designed pages on online HTML validator.While testing the pages some errors were found out which were recorrected.Some of the errors could not corected due to some problems.Evidences of validation HTML are given below: </p>
		<h2>Validation evidence for home page</h2>
		<img src="image/Index.png">
		<h2>Validation evidence for About me page</h2>
		<img src="image/aboutv.png">
		<h2>Validation evidence for CV page</h2>
		<img src="image/CVV.png">
		<h2>Validation evidence for  Social page</h2>
		<img src="image/socialv.png">
		<h2>Validation evidence for Contact page</h2>
		<img src="image/contactv.png">
		<p>Conclusion</p>
			Meeting all the criteia of instruction provided on NILE, I have designed a webpage on my own but I could make my page more effective and professional if I could use other programming languages like javaScript,tabular etc.  but we were restricted to use them. I could use more animations,transitions, css properties in my page for more attractive and effective but I couldn't which is the cons of my page.I hope I will  make pages more informative,effective using more css prperties,html and animations.
